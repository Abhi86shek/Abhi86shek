- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Abhishek. I'm a passionate game developer and strategist programmer. I'm expert in game development using Unity 3D and C#.NET, conducting design reviews, designing role play mechanics, creating prototypes, documenting game design process.
Iâ€™m truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with other game developers. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with multiple talents and understanding a project's key features and bringing ideas from the drawing board into reality. 
As we go through that collaborative process, the ideas start to flow and thatâ€™s always the fun part.
